# SOMEIP-Platform-Comparisons
Collection of SOME/IP projects across STM32, Raspberry Pi, and laptops. Illustrates code structure, library differences, and platform-specific considerations for automotive communication using SOME/IP. Aims to highlight implementation variations and provide comparative insights.

## Overview
This repo contains SOME/IP implementations on STM32, Raspberry Pi, and laptops to showcase code differences and platform-specific requirements.

## Platforms
- **STM32:** SOME/IP for STM32 microcontrollers.
- **Raspberry Pi:** SOME/IP on Raspberry Pi with a Linux environment.
- **Laptop:** SOME/IP on a Linux-based laptop.
